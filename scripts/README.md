## gov.cn XXGK

`govcn_xxgk_crawler.py` is the command entry point for the central gov.cn XXGK
crawler. Prefer the `just` recipes at the repository root:

```bash
just govcn-xxgk-cache-pilot
just govcn-xxgk-live-full
just govcn-xxgk-all-probe
just govcn-xxgk-all-full
just govcn-xxgk-processed-v0
```

See `docs/govcn-xxgk-crawler.md` before changing query configs or running broad
live collection.

`govcn_xxgk_processed_corpus.py` builds the reviewed processed all-policy
corpus v0 from cached interim detail records. It does not send network requests.
